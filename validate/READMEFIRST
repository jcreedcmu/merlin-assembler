Hi!

    This disk was created to allow anyone interested in the history of Apple II
software to confirm for himself that an executable module assembled from
available source files matches the available executable.

    The source files in this image were extracted from the "MER8.Src.259.SHK"
archive available at:
ftp://public.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/images/programming/assembler/merlin/

    Because of the way "SAVE/MERLIN" is coded it generates two pairs of five
random bytes between some of the four object modules that are combined to
create "MERLIN.SYSTEM".  So I appended five bytes each to the end of the source
for both "MACASS.S" and "MACEXEC.S" so that running "SAVE/MERLIN" no longer
generates random bytes.

    This text and "STEPBYSTEP" were prepared using "Notepad" on a system
running Windows XP.  The steps listed in "STEPBYSTEP" were checked on the same
system using version 1.19.3 of AppleWin but should run on any version of
AppleWin or on a real Apple II.

    The instructions in "STEPBYSTEP" assume that you have loaded the image that
contains this text as the disk in slot 7, drive 1 and that you have checked the
"Enable hard disk controller in slot 7" box on the "Disk" tab of the AppleWin
Configuration menu before booting AppleWin.  After booting, you should be at
the '%' prompt under a list of nine possible options with the heading
"MERLIN-8" at the top of the screen.
